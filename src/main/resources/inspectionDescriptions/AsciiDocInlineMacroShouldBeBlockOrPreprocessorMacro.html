Some macros like the <code>include</code> macro are always an a preprocessor macro, not a an inline macro.
Similar for macros like the <code>toc</code> marco that are always a block macro.

<p>Therefore the name of the macro must not be followed by a single colon (<code>:</code>), but a two colons (<code>::</code>).
