When Antora modules don't resolve, this will result a broken link.
<!-- tooltip end -->
In order for this check to work, all dependent modules need to be open in one project.
<p>
The check will not be applied to Antora references that contain a version number, and no
component with that name and version is present in the project.
The plugin will then assume that this information might be stored on a different branch or repository, and that such a check would be impossible to perform.
