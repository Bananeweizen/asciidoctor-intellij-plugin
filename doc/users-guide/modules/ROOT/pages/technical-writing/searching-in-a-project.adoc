== Prerequisites

This assumes that IntelliJ IDEA is open with a project with some existing content.
See xref:./opening-the-first-project.adoc[] and xref:./editor-the-file-asciidoc-file.adoc[] on how to do this.

== Searching within an AsciiDoc project

This describes several ways on how to search through the contents of a project, open the right files.
Use the menu item menu:Navigate[] for a full list of options, or use menu:Help[Find Action...] to search all action available in the IDE.

To return to previously edited files, use the following options:

--
* To return to a previous file, use kbd:[Ctrl+E] and select the file to return to.
* Use kbd:[Alt+Shift+Left] and kbd:[Alt+Shift+Right] to move backwards and forwards in the latest cursor positions.
* To return to the previous editing position, use kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+Backspace].

Search for a text snippet in the current file::

To search within the current file, use kbd:[Ctrl+F].
This is by default case-insensitive and uses a plain text search.
Using the icons at the end of the input field, the use can switch to a case-sensitive search and a search with regular expressions.

Use the menu items menu:In Project[], menu:Module[], menu:Directory[] and menu:Scope[] to limit the search to a specific area.
+
Move the selection up and down, and use the small editor window to edit the code directly.
+
Use btn:[Open in Find Window] to open the list of files in a tool window which allows opening each occurrence in an editor and then jump with kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Down] and kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Up] between them.

Search by File Name::

To search a file by its name, use kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+N].

+
Type parts of the path and the file name to restrict the search to the file.

Search Everywhere::

A user can search for all named elements in a project.
This includes attributes, IDs and section heading.
Use kbd:[Shift+Shift] to open the dialog.
