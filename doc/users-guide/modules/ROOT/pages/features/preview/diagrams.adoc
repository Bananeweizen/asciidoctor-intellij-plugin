The preview of the AsciiDoc plugin supports rendering the diagrams in the preview. Two different types of diagram renderes are supported: <<asciidoctor-diagram>> and <<kroki>>.

== Using Asciidoctor Diagram

By default, the plugin uses {uri-asciidoctor-diagrams-gh}[Asciidoctor Diagram]
that depends on locally installed tools to generate images (ie. {uri-asciidoctor-diagrams-execs}[executables] available in your `PATH` environment variable).

Asciidoctor Diagram renders the content of the editor including all referenced includes, images and diagrams like PlantUML on the fly.
// see: plantuml-png-patch.rb
As JavaFX has a problem displaying SVG files correctly, the plugin displays all diagrams as PNG.

=== Downloading Asciidoctor Diagram

As of AsciiDoc Plugin version 0.31.14+ Asciidoctor Diagram is no longer included in the plugin as default as it adds approximately 15 MB to the download of the installation and each update.

// see: diagram-placeholder.rb + AsciiDocDownloadNotificationProvider.java
When the preview includes a diagram, the plugin shows an editor notification asking the user to download the necessary dependency.

[[kroki,Kroki]]
== Using Kroki

Alternatively, the plugin supports {uri-kroki}[Kroki] instead of Asciidoctor Diagram to render diagrams. Use the plugin's settings to enable Kroki:

When Kroki is enabled, the plugin sends the text diagrams to an instance of Kroki to display them as images in the preview.
By default, it sends your diagrams to the free public cloud instance {uri-kroki}[kroki.io], but users can install Kroki on their own infrastructure.
Once the custom instance is set up, update the server URL in the plugin's settings to point to it.
