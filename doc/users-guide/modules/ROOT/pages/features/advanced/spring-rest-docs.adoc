The plugin supports the `operation::[]`-macro: It provides auto-complete for the editor and renders the contents in preview.

== How it works

When writing documentation with https://docs.spring.io/spring-restdocs/docs/current/reference/html5/[Spring REST Docs], the preview plugin auto-detects the folder `generated-snippets`.

It looks relative to the `pom.xml` for `target/generated-snippets` or relative to `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` for `build/generated-snippets`.

Once it finds this folder, it sets the `snippets` attribute and enables the `+++operation::[]+++` block macro.
