= Validation of AsciiDoc files
:description: The AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ validates cross-references and attributes.
:navtitle: Validation of files

{description}

== How the plugin can help with validation

The IDE can validate for example cross-references and attribute names for a set of AsciiDoc files.
To resolve cross-references, all files need to be in one project.

It will also provide auto-completion for attribute names and references.

If the IDE opens a single file and not a project with all related file, it might show validation errors where it shouldn't.

== How to edit files as a project

Use menu:File[Open...] to select a folder and open it.
The IDE will open files in the folder and its sub-folder as one project.

== Further reading

If files are in separate distinct folders and still belong together, they can still be in one project.
See chapter xref:features/advanced/multimodule.adoc[] for more information.
