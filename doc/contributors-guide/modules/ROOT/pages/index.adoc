:navtitle: Why contribute

This plugin is an open source project.
All the work is done by users and enthusiasts, usually in their spare time.
With all the help it received from users and maintainers as ideas, feedback and code it wouldn't be where it is today.

To continue to be useful and to evolve, this plugin needs continuing contributions.

== What you can do

There are multiple ways where you can help:

* joining the discussions
* giving feedback on ideas
* testing new releases
* contributing source code to fix issues or add new functionality

NOTE: Please ask questions to the maintainers for anything that is missing (either via email or via a GitHub ticket), and we'll update it.

There are two chapters: "`xref:contribute-as-a-user.adoc[]`" and "`xref:contribute-as-a-coder.adoc[]`"
