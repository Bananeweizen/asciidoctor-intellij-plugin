= IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin
Alexander Schwartz
:experimental:

A plugin for the IntelliJ platform (IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, etc) that provides support for the http://www.asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] markup language. You can install the plugin (named "AsciiDoc") from the plugins section inside your JetBrains IDE or download it from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391[JetBrains Plugin Repository].

To support the authors of Asciidoctor, please consider supporting us via https://opencollective.com/asciidoctor[OpenCollective].

*You can meet the maintainers in person:* Please ping them via eMail or chat before or during the event!

The most advanced and recommended preview mode is JavaFX.
To use the JavaFX preview instead of the Swing preview, you'll need to run IntelliJ with 64bit Java and JavaFX installed.
Oracle JDK installations include JavaFX, but can make the IDE unstable and crash.
Pre-bundled OpenJDK installations usually don't include JavaFX.
Therefore, JetBrains OpenJDK pre-bundled with your IDE is recommended.

From 2017.1 onwards a JetBrains OpenJDK 64bit is included even in the Windows versions.
Please only use the JDK provided by JetBrains, as the JavaFX rendering seems to be most stable in the JetBrains JDK. See https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544879-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under[Selecting the JDK version the IDE will run under] for more details.

EXPERIMENTAL:

* Support for _.asciidoctorconfig_ configuration files.
See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/wiki/Support-project-specific-configurations[Wiki page] for details

* Support for Ruby Asciidoctor extensions.
  See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/wiki/Support-for-Asciidoctor-Extensions[Wiki page] for details

== Features

* Right click on a document to apply basic formatting or create tables.
* Refactor Markdown to AsciiDoc: Right click on a file, or use the Refactor menu, and the Markdown document will be replaced by the AsciiDoc equivalent. Also supports undo, in case you're not happy with the result!
* Recognizes the AsciiDoc file extension (.adoc, .asciidoc, .ad)
* Provides a two-pane AsciiDoc preview editor based on https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[AsciidoctorJ] with Live preview.

If you are missing features, please don't hesitate to let me know on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ahus1de[@ahus1de] or make an issue in the issue tracker!

== Dependencies

This project uses AsciiDoctorJ and JRuby for the rendering of the AsciiDoc content.

For the conversion of Markdown to AsciiDoc, we use Pegdown and the https://github.com/bodiam/markdown-to-asciidoc[Markdown to AsciiDoc] converter.

== Build

This plugin is built using Gradle.
If you build or run it the first time it will download the community edition of IntelliJ automatically.

If you have developed the plugin before it changed to Gradle you might want to remove the contents of your `.idea` folder to trigger a re-import of the Gradle project.

To build this plugin, you need to run:

----
./gradlew -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 buildPlugin
----

The ZIP file with plugin to distribute will be located in `build/distributions`.

To run the plugin for development you'll need to start

----
./gradlew -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 runIdea
----
